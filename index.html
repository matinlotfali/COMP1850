        <p>I have been interested in electronic devices since I was a little child. Being encouraged by my mother and my aunt, I became familiar with computer programming at the age of 8. As a pupil, my abilities and my uncontrollable interest which had incorporated with lots of laboratory and interpersonal activities at school convinced me that I want to be a computer specialist and especially a decent programmer in the future.</p>
        <p>At the undergraduate level, my interest became more focused on Software Engineering. Although Object-Oriented Programming and Software Engineering came easy to me, it was Mathematics, Algorithm Design, and Artificial Intelligence that really captured my interest. During my bachelor's degree, I found that artificial intelligence is an interdisciplinary undertaking: today a foundation in statistics, programming, and even calculus is a need to be at the forefront of this subject. This interdisciplinary aspect of the subject suits my abilities well. I have always performed well in all science subjects and found it challenging to apply the knowledge to practical problems. For this reason, I chose to undertake an evolutionary project in my 8th semester on improving fingertip tracking accuracy using genetic programming as my bachelor's thesis. Having presented the thesis, my professors were impressed by my practical skills and were happy to give me some recommendations which led to my previous job and broadened my horizons to continue my education in Canada; as one the pioneer nations in promoting computing science.</p>
        <p>Being perfectionist about selecting the right area of study in its right academic place, in lieu of a superficial choice, did not let me proceed directly to a Master’s Degree after receiving my Bachelor’s Degree. The aforementioned gap has provided me with a window of opportunity to be bound with business and research society. Besides, I have also been honoured to be a permanent board member of the Association of Computer Engineering of Islamic Azad University where we could have access to the most up-to-date information about specific computer subjects through speeches and workshops.</p>
        <p>In selecting the University of Victoria, I have been influenced by the way your program addresses Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Computer Engineering. Additionally, I have been influenced by the wide range of networking/career opportunities that your program entails. I believe that I will be able to contribute to and learn from the academically challenging environment at the University of Victoria.</p>
